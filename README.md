# UserJS
A small JavaScript framework for Web Browsers in order to bypass AdBlock detectors and other kind of "annoyances".

**NOTE**: Those scripts are tested only in Chromium browser with Tampermonkey.

# Structure
The Framework consists in a single core library called "UserJS" and two "extension scripts":
* UserJS: Core library
* AdBlock Stealth: Hide AdBlock from websites
* Ads Killer: Remove/Bypass website annoyances (banner, paywalls, watermarks, ...)
